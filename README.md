# Wine-Festival-Schedule

### **Description:**
This is a project that allowed me to gain some practice at creating HTML tables, including rows and columns. The page also includes a header and footer. The table displays a schedule of events in an organized and easy to read fashion. The event is for a fictional wine festival owned by a fictional family vineyard.
